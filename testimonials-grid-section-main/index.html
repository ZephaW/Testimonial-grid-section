        in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every pennyâ€™s worth.</b></p>
      <p class="review">"I was an EMT for many years before i joined the bootcamp. I've been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and found in incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I've successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup "</p>

       <p class="intro"><b>Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</b></p>
       <p class="review">"Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step.I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and stuff did not disappoint, They were very hands-on and i never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was oustanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I've often reffered to it during interviews as an exmaple of my development experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100& recommend!</p>

        learning from their experiences was easy.</b></p>
      <p class="review">"The staff seem genuinly concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The program gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from an incredible community of smart and amazing people"</p>
