              <p class="intro"><b>I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not
                      more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.</b></p>
              <p class="review">"I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've been looking to make
                  a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for
                  the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12
                  weeks were the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I've
                  successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup "</p>

              <p class="intro"><b>Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</b></p>
              <p class="review">"Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. I needed some
                  structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged
                  to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program.
                  The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint, They were very hands-on and I never had
                  to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took
                  my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I've often
                  referred to it during interviews as an example of my development experience. It certainly
                  helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100%
                  recommend!</p>

              <p class="review">"The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing.
                  The program gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present
                  myself as a capable junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the
